### Data Entry Analysis about Zooplanktons

#### Problems in the dataset related to the Zooplanktons

* Some data are missing in the datasets.
* Some of the data are marked orange. There is no indication of what it means.
* One of the graphs has neither title nor any description of what it represents on the x and y axis.
* There is no clear column description on the datasets.
* How do they differentiate the day and night distribution of the zooplanktons? No details on that were specific.
* They have specified mentioned station B in one of the datasets, but havenâ€™t provided any specific details related to it nor have they mentioned anything about station A.
* Data redundancy and irregular collection of data.

> Due to the above mentioned problems in the zooplankton datasets, I suggest a  **data collection system (DCD)**, a computer application that allows data collection, structures information in a systematic fashion, and enalbles data anlysis. Example for a data collection system can be an **interactive system**, a system that allows the users to enter data, validate and verify data, and allows user interaction and error reduction.
